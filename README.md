# Norman Köhring
Code Artist

## Introduction

Hi there! I am a programmer, OpenSource enthusiast and hacker based in Berlin, Germany.

I call myself a code artist because programming can and should be seen as a creative process – and that is what I strive for! Just like a painter loves to paint or a musician loves to sing or play an instrument, I love to think about concepts and patterns, and craft pieces of art with code.

I'm working for [Wunderdog](https://wunder.dog). We design and develop digital experiences. Do you want to create something beautiful and make the world a better place? We'd love to help you! Leave me a message any time and I will come back to you as soon as possible.

## Experience

Since 2007 I am freelancing as programmer and consultant. I worked at a lot of different places, from little known start-ups to well known companies like Nokia and Telekom.

Together with entrepreneurs, UI/UX experts and engineers of many fields I created new and beautiful things.

Please see [my CV](https://github.com/nkoehring/cv/blob/master/cv.pdf) for a more detailed list.

## Coaching

Many people want to learn and grow their experience. Whenever I can, I try to help them with my knowledge and experience. I already voluntarily coached at RailsGirls and JugendHackt. I also helped children with their first steps in programming at the Berlin CoderDojo.
